A simple fan controller using a Digispark Pro, DS18B20 temperature sensor. A TIP31C transistor and protection diode control the power to the fan.

The DallasTemperature code was modified to handle the lack of yield function in the Arduino implementation of the ATTiny167.

![Circuit Diagram of the controller, the temperature controller is linked to pin 9 and the output is on Pin 11](https://github.com/Workshopshed/FanController/blob/main/Circuit.png)
